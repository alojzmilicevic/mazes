# Maze Traversal

:checkered_flag: This Python project takes an image of a maze and converts it into a matrix. It then uses various algorithms, including breadth-first and depth-first search, to traverse the maze and find a solution. The traversal of the maze can also be animated for visualizing the process. :hourglass:

## Getting Started

:rocket: To get started with this project, you will need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed on your machine. You can then clone the repository and run the code to see the results.

git clone https://github.com/alojzmilicevic/mazes.git

## Requirements

:page_facing_up: Python 3.x
:file_folder: [Libraries]

## Usage

:gear: To use the project, simply run the `main.py` script and follow the prompts. You will be asked to provide the path to an image of a maze and choose an algorithm for traversing the maze. The resulting matrix and traversal animation will be displayed.

I hope this revised template is helpful! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
